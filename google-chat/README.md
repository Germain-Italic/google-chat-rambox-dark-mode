# Google Chat dark mode theme

## Warning

Class names look ultra-random and will probably break on the next update ðŸ˜’.

### Edit May 29, 2021:

https://chat.google.com is now redirecting to https://mail.google.com/chat which is now loading iframes from https://chat.google.com, therefore, in-frame styling is not supported and the google-chat code is not working at the moment.

## How-to

1. Open your favorite browser to https://chat.google.com/ and toggle Developer tools using F12 or cmd/ctrl-shift-i.
2. Use the inspector to reveal the class names and switch colors as you like

3. Fork this repository and submit a pull request with a screenshot if you've been creative!
